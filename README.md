# Blog-Website
A blog site built with HTML, CSS, Eleventy, &amp; Netflify CMS

# Intro
This [blog website](https://nguyenyenchi.com/) was started thanks to:

* My love for building my own blog where I can share my data learning journey and other interests to others
* My chance to practice HTML & CSS I learned at uni
* My preference to write posts in Markdown

# Implementation
The creation of this personal blog site was inspired by and credited to [Kevin Powell's personal blog projects](https://github.com/kevin-powell/JAMStack-blog-starter#).

During the process, I've learnt to:

* Build simple web pages with HTML & CSS
* Use Eleventy as a Static Site Generator to create the site based on pre-created templates
* Use Netlify CMS to manage site content
